       	     	<td>SMOKE ALARMS-There are thousands of home fires ,every year, which result in deaths annually. Almost half of these deaths resulted from fires that were reported between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m., the time period in which most people sleep. For this reason, providing smoke alarms in bedrooms may be the single most important step toward preventing fire-related casualties in residential buildings. Install at least one smoke alarm in every bedroom. Install additional smoke alarms in hallways and common areas in the vicinity of bedrooms. Make sure the smoke alarms within your home are interconnected so the activation of one alarm will activate all alarms within the home.

       	     	<td>ESCAPE PLANS-Because fire is a risk in every building — whether you sleep, study, or work there — you should always have an escape plan. You may need to escape within a few minutes of a fire’s start, so your safe exit depends on immediate warning from smoke alarms and advance planning of escape routes. Include two ways out of every room in all escape plans. Designate a location to meet outside the building. Verify that smoke alarms are installed to provide early detection and warning so you’ll have enough time to execute your escape plan.</td>

       	     	<td>CANDLES AND INCENSE-Candles and incense are often used to create ambiance or help celebrate a special event, but they are open flames that pose a threat of fire. Most candle fires take place in the bedroom, and many occur when candles are left unattended. In addition, the winter holidays and New Year’s Eve are peak times for candle fires, so be sure to exercise caution when celebrating with open flames. Never leave candles or incense unattended, and always extinguish them before leaving the room or going to sleep. Keep candles and incense away from curtains, clothing, books and newspapers, and other combustible items. Keep candles and incense away from flammable liquids. </td>

       	     	<td>COOKING-Cooking fires are the leading cause of home fires and household fire injuries. Unattended cooking is the leading cause of these fires, most of which start with the ignition of common household items including grease, paper, cabinets and curtains.Never leave food unattended while it’s cooking on the stove, and closely monitor food cooking in the oven. Maintain a clean and tidy cooking area that is free of items that catch on fire easily, such as cloth (curtains, potholders, towels, etc.), paper (cook books, food packaging, newspapers, etc.), and plastic (food packaging, storage containers, etc.). Never plug microwaves into extension cords, and never microwave metal containers or tinfoil. Keep children and pets away from cooking areas.  </td>

       	     	<td>ELECTRICITY-Electrical distribution equipment poses serious fire safety threats that can even be fatal, especially when equipment is used incorrectly. Protect electrical outlets with plastic safety covers if small children are present in your home. Never operate electrical appliances around bathtubs, showers, or puddles of standing water. Replace or repair frayed, loose, or otherwise damaged cords on all electronics</td>

       	     	<td>GASOLINE- Each year gasoline causes several thousand household fires, many of which result in injury and even death. It is helpful to remember gasoline is a volatile liquid that is constantly releasing flammable vapors, which are heavier than air and accumulate at the lowest point in an area. If released inside a building, these vapors sink to floor level and spread out across the room, and if these vapors make contact with an ignition source a flash-fire will likely result. Keep gasoline out of children's reach and sight, and never allow children to handle gas. Clean up spills immediately and discard clean-up materials properly. Never use gasoline inside the home or as a cleaning agent.</td>
